        - exam
- bookmark questions that you do not know, review later
- for each technology, focus on following:
  - when to use it
  - how to control access
  - how to manage performance
  - data distribution strategies (+scaling, backup)
  - key features
 - Focus on solutions instead of technologies
 - Focus on operations and infrastructure instead of analysis and advanced ML
 - Focus on the "-ities": Security, Scalability, Reliability, Flexibility, Portability, etc.
- Design flexible data representations, data pipeline, data processing infrastructure
  - storage and databases - cloud sql/cloud spanner comparison (exam tip)
  - server based processing

  - cloud dataproc, spark are important. dataproc+bigquery solution (augments bq)
  - check out dataflow templates
 - Exam Tips
  - try to find the service given the feature
  - storage, how data is stored and use-cases a particular solution is optimized for. 
  - formats important - avro, json, xml, csv
  - check out data types supported by each product
